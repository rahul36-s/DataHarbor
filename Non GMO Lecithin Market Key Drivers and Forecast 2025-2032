The market growth is primarily driven by the rising consumer demand for clean-label, natural, and non-GMO products in the food and beverage industry. As health-conscious consumers increasingly opt for products free from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the demand for non-GMO lecithin has surged, especially in sectors such as bakery, confectionery, and dairy products.
